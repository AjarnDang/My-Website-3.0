        Hey, Thornthan’s here! I’m a Web Developer and UX/UI Designer who always
        inspired, fresh, and never stops learning.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 leading-6">
        With a background in Information Technology and more than two years of
        industry experience, I specialize in designing and building functional,
        modern, and intuitive interfaces. Currently, I work full-time as a UX/UI
        Designer, where I bring ideas to life through Next.js, TypeScript, and
        Framer. Beyond design, I’m always exploring Web3 technologies,
        experimenting with decentralized applications (dApps), blockchain UX,
        and digital ownership.
